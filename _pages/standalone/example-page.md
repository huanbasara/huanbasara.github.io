# Example Standalone Page

This is an example of how to create other standalone pages using the generic `standalone` layout.

## Features

- Clean, minimal design
- Dark/light theme toggle
- Responsive layout
- No sidebar or navigation
- Perfect for sharing

## Usage

1. Create a new markdown file in `_pages/standalone/`
2. Use `layout: standalone` in the front matter
3. Add your content in markdown
4. The page will be isolated from the main blog

## Custom Layouts

For specialized pages like the movie watchlist, you can:

1. Copy `_layouts/standalone.html` to `_layouts/your-custom-layout.html`
2. Modify it with your specific functionality
3. Use `layout: your-custom-layout` in your page's front matter

This way you can create different types of standalone pages while keeping the base template reusable.
